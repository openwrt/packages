Subject: [PATCH] rtp-recv: fix crash on empty UDP packets (CVE-2014-3970)

On FIONREAD returning 0 bytes, we cannot return success, as the caller
(rtpoll_work_cb in module-rtp-recv.c) would then try to
pa_memblock_unref(chunk.memblock) and, because memblock is NULL, trigger
an assertion.

Also we have to read out the possible empty packet from the socket, so
that the kernel doesn't tell us again and again about it.
