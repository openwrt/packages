## âœ… Formalities

- [ ] I have reviewed the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.

### If your PR contains a patch:

- [ ] It can be applied using `git am`
- [ ] It has been refreshed to avoid offsets, fuzzes, etc., using
  ```bash
  make package/<your-package>/refresh V=s
  ```
- [ ] It is structured in a way that it is potentially upstreamable
<sub>(e.g., subject line, commit description, etc.)</sub>
<sub>We must try to upstream patches to reduce maintenance burden.</sub>
