Subject: [PATCH] Ignore artist when looking up existing container

This prevents creation of multiple album containers for compilation
albums (i.e. one separate album for each artist) when adding files via
inotify, which causes the scanner cache to be invalidated all the time.

OTOH, different albums with identical names ("Greatest Hits", "Love
Songs") are now listed as just a single album in the "Album" container.
This might be solved using some heuristic based on music file location
(same directory / different directories).

The new behaviour is usually the same as encountered when doing a full
rescan, because there's a scanner cache that is used during full rescans
and that cache ignores artist names as well.
