Subject: [PATCH] MDEV-17200 - pthread_detach called for already detached
 threads

pthread_detach_this_thread() was intended to be defined to something
meaningful only on some ancient unixes, which don't have
pthread_attr_setdetachstate() defined. Otherwise, on normal unixes,
threads are created detached in the first place.

This was broken in 0f01bf267680244ec488adaf65a42838756ed48e so that
we started calling pthread_detach() for already detached threads.
Intention was to detach aria checkpoint thread.

However in 87007dc2f71634cc460271eb277ad851ec69c04b aria service threads
were made joinable with appropriate handling, which makes breaking
revision unneccessary.

Revert remnants of 0f01bf267680244ec488adaf65a42838756ed48e, so that
pthread_detach_this_thread() is meaningful only on some ancient unixes
again.
