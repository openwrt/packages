# Telegraf Configuration
#
# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
#
# Plugins must be declared in here to be active.
# To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.
#
# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.
#
# Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply surround
# them with ${}. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "${STR_VAR}"),
# for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, ${INT_VAR}, ${BOOL_VAR})


# Global tags can be specified here in key="value" format.
[global_tags]
  # dc = "us-east-1" # will tag all metrics with dc=us-east-1
  # rack = "1a"
  ## Environment variables can be used as tags, and throughout the config file
  # user = "$USER"

# Configuration for telegraf agent
[agent]
  ## Default data collection interval for all inputs
  interval = "10s"
  ## Rounds collection interval to 'interval'
  ## ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
  round_interval = true

  ## Telegraf will send metrics to outputs in batches of at most
  ## metric_batch_size metrics.
  ## This controls the size of writes that Telegraf sends to output plugins.
  metric_batch_size = 1000

  ## Maximum number of unwritten metrics per output.  Increasing this value
  ## allows for longer periods of output downtime without dropping metrics at the
  ## cost of higher maximum memory usage.
  metric_buffer_limit = 10000

  ## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
  ## Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
  ## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
  ## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
  collection_jitter = "0s"

  ## Collection offset is used to shift the collection by the given amount.
  ## This can be be used to avoid many plugins querying constraint devices
  ## at the same time by manually scheduling them in time.
  # collection_offset = "0s"

  ## Default flushing interval for all outputs. Maximum flush_interval will be
  ## flush_interval + flush_jitter
  flush_interval = "10s"
  ## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
  ## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
  ## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
  flush_jitter = "0s"

  ## Collected metrics are rounded to the precision specified. Precision is
  ## specified as an interval with an integer + unit (e.g. 0s, 10ms, 2us, 4s).
  ## Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s".
  ##
  ## By default or when set to "0s", precision will be set to the same
  ## timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s:
  ##   ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s"
  ##       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"
  ##
  ## Precision will NOT be used for service inputs. It is up to each individual
  ## service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.
  precision = "0s"

  ## Log at debug level.
  # debug = false
  ## Log only error level messages.
  # quiet = false

  ## Log format controls the way messages are logged and can be one of "text",
  ## "structured" or, on Windows, "eventlog".
  # logformat = "text"

  ## Message key for structured logs, to override the default of "msg".
  ## Ignored if `logformat` is not "structured".
  # structured_log_message_key = "message"

  ## Name of the file to be logged to or stderr if unset or empty. This
  ## setting is ignored for the "eventlog" format.
  # logfile = ""

  ## The logfile will be rotated after the time interval specified.  When set
  ## to 0 no time based rotation is performed.  Logs are rotated only when
  ## written to, if there is no log activity rotation may be delayed.
  # logfile_rotation_interval = "0h"

  ## The logfile will be rotated when it becomes larger than the specified
  ## size.  When set to 0 no size based rotation is performed.
  # logfile_rotation_max_size = "0MB"

  ## Maximum number of rotated archives to keep, any older logs are deleted.
  ## If set to -1, no archives are removed.
  # logfile_rotation_max_archives = 5

  ## Pick a timezone to use when logging or type 'local' for local time.
  ## Example: America/Chicago
  # log_with_timezone = ""

  ## Override default hostname, if empty use os.Hostname()
  # hostname = ""
  ## If set to true, do no set the "host" tag in the telegraf agent.
  # omit_hostname = false

  ## Method of translating SNMP objects. Can be "netsnmp" (deprecated) which
  ## translates by calling external programs snmptranslate and snmptable,
  ## or "gosmi" which translates using the built-in gosmi library.
  # snmp_translator = "netsnmp"

  ## Name of the file to load the state of plugins from and store the state to.
  ## If uncommented and not empty, this file will be used to save the state of
  ## stateful plugins on termination of Telegraf. If the file exists on start,
  ## the state in the file will be restored for the plugins.
  # statefile = ""

  ## Flag to skip running processors after aggregators
  ## By default, processors are run a second time after aggregators. Changing
  ## this setting to true will skip the second run of processors.
  # skip_processors_after_aggregators = false

#   ## Configuration of type conversion for 64-bit unsigned int
#   ## IoTDB currently DOES NOT support unsigned integers (version 13.x).
#   ## 32-bit unsigned integers are safely converted into 64-bit signed integers by the plugin,
#   ## however, this is not true for 64-bit values in general as overflows may occur.
#   ## The following setting allows to specify the handling of 64-bit unsigned integers.
#   ## Available values are:
#   ##   - "int64"       --  convert to 64-bit signed integers and accept overflows
#   ##   - "int64_clip"  --  convert to 64-bit signed integers and clip the values on overflow to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
#   ##   - "text"        --  convert to the string representation of the value
#   # uint64_conversion = "int64_clip"
#
#   ## Configuration of TimeStamp
#   ## TimeStamp is always saved in 64bits int. timestamp_precision specifies the unit of timestamp.
#   ## Available value:
#   ## "second", "millisecond", "microsecond", "nanosecond"(default)
#   # timestamp_precision = "nanosecond"
#
#   ## Handling of tags
#   ## Tags are not fully supported by IoTDB.
#   ## A guide with suggestions on how to handle tags can be found here:
#   ##     https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/Master/API/InfluxDB-Protocol.html
#   ##
#   ## Available values are:
#   ##   - "fields"     --  convert tags to fields in the measurement
#   ##   - "device_id"  --  attach tags to the device ID
#   ##
#   ## For Example, a metric named "root.sg.device" with the tags `tag1: "private"`  and  `tag2: "working"` and
#   ##  fields `s1: 100`  and `s2: "hello"` will result in the following representations in IoTDB
#   ##   - "fields"     --  root.sg.device, s1=100, s2="hello", tag1="private", tag2="working"
#   ##   - "device_id"  --  root.sg.device.private.working, s1=100, s2="hello"
#   # convert_tags_to = "device_id"
#
#   ## Handling of unsupported characters
#   ## Some characters in different versions of IoTDB are not supported in path name
#   ## A guide with suggetions on valid paths can be found here:
#   ## for iotdb 0.13.x           -> https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/V0.13.x/Reference/Syntax-Conventions.html#identifiers
#   ## for iotdb 1.x.x and above  -> https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/V1.3.x/User-Manual/Syntax-Rule.html#identifier
#   ##
#   ## Available values are:
#   ##   - "1.0", "1.1", "1.2", "1.3"  -- use backticks to enclose tags with forbidden characters
#   ##                                    such as @$#:[]{}() and space
#   ##   - "0.13"                      -- use backticks to enclose tags with forbidden characters
#   ##                                    such as space

  ## Device metadata tags to add on systems supporting it (Linux only)
  ## Use 'udevadm info -q property -n <device>' to get a list of properties.

  ## Using the same metadata source as device_tags, you can also customize the
  ## name of the device via templates.
  ## The 'name_templates' parameter is a list of templates to try and apply to
  ## the device. The template may contain variables in the form of '$PROPERTY' or
  ## '${PROPERTY}'. The first template which does not contain any variables not
  ## present for the device is used as the device name tag.
  ## The typical use case is for LVM volumes, to get the VG/LV name instead of
  ## the near-meaningless DM-0 name.

#     ##   https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/28619.html?spm=a2c4g.11186623.6.690.1938ad41wg8QSq
#     ##
#     ## Note, that by default dimension filter includes the list of discovered
#     ## objects in scope (if discovery is enabled). Values specified here would
#     ## be added into the list of discovered objects. You can specify either
#     ## single dimension:
#     # dimensions = '{"instanceId": "p-example"}'

#     ## Notation is
#     ##   <measurement_tag_name>:<JMES query path (https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html)>
#     ## To figure out which fields are available, consult the
