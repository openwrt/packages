define Package/pv/description
 Pipe Viewer is a terminal-based tool for monitoring the progress of data
 through a pipeline. It can be inserted into any normal pipeline between
 two processes to give a visual indication of how quickly data is passing
 through, how long it has taken, how near to completion it is, and an
 estimate of how long it will be until completion.
