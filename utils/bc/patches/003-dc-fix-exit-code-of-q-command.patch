Subject: [PATCH] dc: fix exit code of q command

The exit code for "echo q | dc" is 1 for dc-1.4.1;
while the exit code for "echo q | dc" is 0 for dc-1.4.

Here is the answer from ken@gnu.org:
dc-1.4 was right.  There was a rewrite of a chunk of code for 1.4.1 to
fix a corner case in the Q command, and somehow the placement of the
clean-up label for the 'q' command got misplaced on the error-handling
branch instead of the clean-exit branch.  The patch below fixes this
(it is committed for whenever the next bc/dc release gets made).

Thanks for the report,
