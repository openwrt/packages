define Package/python3-setuptools-scm/description
setuptools_scm extracts Python package versions from git or hg metadata
instead of declaring them as the version argument or in a SCM managed
file.

Additionally setuptools_scm provides setuptools with a list of files
that are managed by the SCM (i.e. it automatically adds all of the
SCM-managed files to the sdist). Unwanted files must be excluded by
discarding them via MANIFEST.in.
