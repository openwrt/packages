define Package/python3-cython/description
Cython is a language that makes writing C extensions for Python as easy
as Python itself. Cython is based on Pyrex, but supports more cutting
edge functionality and optimizations.

The Cython language is very close to the Python language, but Cython
additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on
variables and class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate
very efficient C code from Cython code.

This makes Cython the ideal language for wrapping external C libraries,
and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.
