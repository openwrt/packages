Subject: Patch description - fix Chicken Scheme compiler behavior

Chicken is a Scheme interpreter and compiler. csi is the interpreter,
and csc is the compiler, which translates Scheme into C and calls gcc.

This patch changes the compiler, csc.

The Chicken build system will dynamically build the file chicken-config.h,
and for OpenWRT this is done *inside the buildroot*. But then, the values
in that file are hardcoded into the csc binary, and they don't work well
in the target device:
1. -ldl is passed to ld
2. -fmacro-prefix-map=... is passed to gcc, with the original path from the
   buildroot
and these two will not work on OpenWRT (and are not needed anyway), so the
patch included actually modifies the build system to remove those two flags.
Then csc works on the target device!
