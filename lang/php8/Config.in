config PHP8_DOM
	bool "Enable DOM support"
	select PHP8_LIBXML
	default y
	help
	  Without php8-mod-dom, this option does not provide a PHP8
	  programmer the XML DOM functionality (it only adds DOM for internal
	  use by php-cli, php-cgi, etc.). Therefore please consider adding
	  php8-mod-dom to provide this functionality to PHP8 consumers.

config PHP8_GETTEXT
	bool "Enable gettext support"
	default y
	help
	  Without php8-mod-gettext, this option does not provide a PHP8
	  programmer the gettext functionality (it only adds gettext for internal
	  use by php-cli, php-cgi, etc.). Therefore please consider adding
	  php8-mod-gettext to provide this functionality to PHP8 consumers.

config PHP8_INTL
	bool "Enable Internationalization support"
	default y
	help
	  Note that this option depends in ICU library which is built without data
	  by default. This is to satisfy programs build and run dependencies but to
	  keep the installed footprint small on the target system(s).
	  However, the data is required to make the ICU library useful - and thus
	  directly affects PHPs intl extension, too - so consider to also
	  select PHP8_FULLICUDATA.
	  Without php8-mod-intl, this option does not provide a PHP8
	  programmer the intl functionality (it only adds intl for internal
	  use by php-cli, php-cgi, etc.). Therefore please consider adding
	  php8-mod-intl to provide this functionality to PHP8 consumers.

config PHP8_FULLICUDATA
	bool "Add dependency to full ICU Data"
	default n
	help
	  The ICU library is built without data by default. This is to satisfy
	  programs build and run dependencies but to keep the installed footprint
	  small on the target system(s).
	  However, the data is required to make the ICU library useful - and thus
	  directly affects PHP's intl extension, too.
	  When you do not enable this here, then you can still manually select
	  the package icu-full-data, or install it later.

config PHP8_SYSTEMTZDATA
	bool "Use system timezone data instead of PHP's built-in database"
	depends on PACKAGE_php8-cli || PACKAGE_php8-cgi || PACKAGE_apache-mod-php8
	default y
	help
	  Enabling this feature automatically selects the zoneinfo-core package
	  which contains data for UTC timezone. To use other timezones you have
	  to install the corresponding zoneinfo-... package(s).
