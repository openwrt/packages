Subject: [PATCH 4/9] batman-adv: fix removing neigh_ifinfo

When an interface is removed separately, all neighbors need to be
checked if they have a neigh_ifinfo structure for that particular
interface. If that is the case, remove that ifinfo so any references to
a hard interface can be freed.

This is a regression introduced by
9bb33b8d88e318c4879d37d06ad28e3e018b9036 ("batman-adv: split tq
information in neigh_node struct")
