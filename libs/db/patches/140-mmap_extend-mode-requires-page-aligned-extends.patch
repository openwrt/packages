Subject: [PATCH] MMAP_EXTEND mode requires we extend in full system page increments
Date: Wed, 12 Mar 2014 11:58:31 +0100

When extending a mmap file we must ensure we extend by full system pages,
otherwise there is a risk (when the filesystem page size is smaller than
the system page size) that we will not allocate disk extents to store
the memory and it will be lost resulting in data loss.
