+In brackets after each field name are the types which may have a value for
+that field. The types are L (Listeners), F (Frontends), B (Backends), and
+S (Servers).
+
+  0. pxname [LFBS]: proxy name
+  1. svname [LFBS]: service name (FRONTEND for frontend, BACKEND for backend,
+     any name for server/listener)
+  2. qcur [..BS]: current queued requests. For the backend this reports the
+     number queued without a server assigned.
+  3. qmax [..BS]: max value of qcur
+  4. scur [LFBS]: current sessions
+  5. smax [LFBS]: max sessions
+  6. slim [LFBS]: configured session limit
+  7. stot [LFBS]: cumulative number of connections
+  8. bin [LFBS]: bytes in
+  9. bout [LFBS]: bytes out
+ 10. dreq [LFB.]: requests denied because of security concerns.
+     - For tcp this is because of a matched tcp-request content rule.
+     - For http this is because of a matched http-request or tarpit rule.
+ 11. dresp [LFBS]: responses denied because of security concerns.
+     - For http this is because of a matched http-request rule, or
+       "option checkcache".
+ 12. ereq [LF..]: request errors. Some of the possible causes are:
+     - early termination from the client, before the request has been sent.
+     - read error from the client
+     - client timeout
+     - client closed connection
+     - various bad requests from the client.
+     - request was tarpitted.
+ 13. econ [..BS]: number of requests that encountered an error trying to
+     connect to a backend server. The backend stat is the sum of the stat
+     for all servers of that backend, plus any connection errors not
+     associated with a particular server (such as the backend having no
+     active servers).
+ 14. eresp [..BS]: response errors. srv_abrt will be counted here also.
+     Some other errors are:
+     - write error on the client socket (won't be counted for the server stat)
+     - failure applying filters to the response.
+ 15. wretr [..BS]: number of times a connection to a server was retried.
+ 16. wredis [..BS]: number of times a request was redispatched to another
+     server. The server value counts the number of times that server was
+     switched away from.
+ 17. status [LFBS]: status (UP/DOWN/NOLB/MAINT/MAINT(via)...)
+ 18. weight [..BS]: server weight (server), total weight (backend)
+ 19. act [..BS]: server is active (server), number of active servers (backend)
+ 20. bck [..BS]: server is backup (server), number of backup servers (backend)
+ 21. chkfail [...S]: number of failed checks. (Only counts checks failed when
+     the server is up.)
+ 22. chkdown [..BS]: number of UP->DOWN transitions. The backend counter counts
+     transitions to the whole backend being down, rather than the sum of the
+     counters for each server.
+ 23. lastchg [..BS]: number of seconds since the last UP<->DOWN transition
+ 24. downtime [..BS]: total downtime (in seconds). The value for the backend
+     is the downtime for the whole backend, not the sum of the server downtime.
+ 25. qlimit [...S]: configured maxqueue for the server, or nothing in the
+     value is 0 (default, meaning no limit)
+ 26. pid [LFBS]: process id (0 for first instance, 1 for second, ...)
+ 27. iid [LFBS]: unique proxy id
+ 28. sid [L..S]: server id (unique inside a proxy)
+ 29. throttle [...S]: current throttle percentage for the server, when
+     slowstart is active, or no value if not in slowstart.
+ 30. lbtot [..BS]: total number of times a server was selected, either for new
+     sessions, or when re-dispatching. The server counter is the number
+     of times that server was selected.
+ 31. tracked [...S]: id of proxy/server if tracking is enabled.
+ 32. type [LFBS]: (0=frontend, 1=backend, 2=server, 3=socket/listener)
+ 33. rate [.FBS]: number of sessions per second over last elapsed second
+ 34. rate_lim [.F..]: configured limit on new sessions per second
+ 35. rate_max [.FBS]: max number of new sessions per second
+ 36. check_status [...S]: status of last health check, one of:
         UNK     -> unknown

         SOCKERR -> socket error
