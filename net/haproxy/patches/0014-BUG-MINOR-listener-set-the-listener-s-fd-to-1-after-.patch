Subject: [PATCH 14/21] BUG/MINOR: listener: set the listener's fd to -1 after
 deletion

This is currently harmless, but when stopping a listener, its fd is
closed but not set to -1, so it is not possible to re-open it again.
Currently this has no impact but can have after the abstract sockets
are modified to perform a complete close on soft-reload.

The fix can be backported to 1.5 and may even apply to 1.4 (protocols.c).
