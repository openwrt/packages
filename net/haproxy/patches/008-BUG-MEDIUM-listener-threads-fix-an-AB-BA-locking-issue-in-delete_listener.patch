    BUG/MEDIUM: listener/threads: fix an AB/BA locking issue in delete_listener()
    
    The delete_listener() function takes the listener's lock before taking
    the proto_lock, which is contrary to what other functions do, possibly
    causing an AB/BA deadlock. In practice the two only places where both
    are taken are during protocol_enable_all() and delete_listener(), the
    former being used during startup and the latter during stop. In practice
    during reload floods, it is technically possible for a thread to be
    initializing the listeners while another one is stopping. While this
    is too hard to trigger on 2.0 and above due to the synchronization of
    all threads during startup, it's reasonably easy to do in 1.9 by having
    hundreds of listeners, starting 64 threads and flooding them with reloads
    like this :
    
       $ while usleep 50000; do killall -USR2 haproxy; done
    
    Usually in less than a minute, all threads will be deadlocked. The fix
    consists in always taking the proto_lock before the listener lock. It
    seems to be the only place where these two locks were reversed. This
    fix needs to be backported to 2.0, 1.9, and 1.8.
