# This is a yaml version of the stubby configuration file (it replaces the 
# json based stubby.conf file used in earlier versions of getdns/stubby).
#
# For more information see
# https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/Configuring+Stubby
#
# This format does not fully support all yaml features - the restrictions are:
#   - the outer-most data structure must be a yaml mapping
#   - mapping keys must be yaml scalars
#   - plain scalars will be converted to json unchanged
#   - non-plain scalars (quoted, double-quoted, wrapped) will be interpreted
#     as json strings, i.e. double quoted. 
#   - yaml tags are not supported
#   - IPv6 addresses ending in :: are not yet supported (use ::0)
#

# Logging is currently configured at runtime using command line arguments. See

# Ordered list composed of one or more transport protocols: 
# GETDNS_TRANSPORT_UDP, GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TCP or GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS
# If only one transport value is specified it will be the only transport used. 
# Should it not be available basic resolution will fail.
# Fallback transport options are specified by including multiple values in the
# list.  Strict mode (see below) should use only GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS.
dns_transport_list:
  - GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS

# Selects Strict or Opportunistic Usage profile as described in
# https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dprive-dtls-and-tls-profiles/
# Strict mode requires that authentication information for the upstreams is
# specified below. Opportunistic may fallback to clear text DNS if UDP or TCP
# is included in the transport list above.
# For Strict use        GETDNS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED
# For Opportunistic use GETDNS_AUTHENTICATION_NONE
tls_authentication: GETDNS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED

# EDNS0 option to pad the size of the DNS query to the given blocksize
# 256 is currently recommended by 
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dprive-padding-policy-01

# EDNS0 option for keepalive idle timeout in ms as specified in

# This keeps idle TLS connections open to avoid the overhead of opening a new 
# connection for every query.
idle_timeout: 10000

# Set the listen addresses for the stubby DAEMON. This specifies localhost IPv4
# and IPv6. It will listen on port 53 by default. Use <IP_address>@<port> to 
# specify a different port
# MODIFIED - Run on non-privleged port (5453) so we don't need root. Also allows a 
#            recursive caching resolver (like unbound) to serve network and use
#            stubby as proxy to request DNS over TLS

# Instructs stubby to distribute queries across all available name servers. 
# Set to 0 to treat the upstreams below as an ordered list and use a single
# upstream until it becomes unavailable, then use the next one.
# MODIFIED - Since we are only using one resolver (QUAD9) in this modified conf,
#            set this to 0 and prefer ipv6 resolver first. If your network/ISP
#            does support ipv6, remove the ipv6 upstream resolver.

# Require DNSSEC validation. For releases earlier than 1.2 a trust anchor must
# be configured configured manually. This can be done with unbound-anchor.
# MODIFIED NOTE - This installation expects a resolver like unbound to serve the network.
#                 Because of this, let resolver handle DNSSEC.

# Limit the total number of outstanding queries permitted
# limit_outstanding_queries: 100

# Specify the timeout on getting a response to an individual request
# (default 5s)
# timeout: 1

# Specify the list of upstream recursive name servers to send queries to
# In Strict mode upstreams need either a tls_auth_name or a tls_pubkey_pinset
# so the upstream can be authenticated.
# The list below includes all the available test servers but only has the subset
# operated the stubby/getdns developers enabled. You can enable any of the
# others you want to use by uncommenting the relevant section. See:
# https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+Test+Servers
# If you don't have IPv6 then comment then out those upstreams.
# In Opportunistic mode they only require an IP address in address_data.
# The information for an upstream can include the following:
# - address_data: IPv4 or IPv6 address of the upstream
#   port: Port for UDP/TCP (default is 53)
#   tls_auth_name: Authentication domain name checked against the server
#                  certificate
#   tls_pubkey_pinset: An SPKI pinset verified against the keys in the server
#                      certificate
#     - digest: Only "sha256" is currently supported
#       value: Base64 encoded value of the sha256 fingerprint of the public
#              key
#   tls_port: Port for TLS (default is 853)
