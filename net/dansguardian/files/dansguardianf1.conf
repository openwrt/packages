# DansGuardian filter group config file for version 2.12.0.0


# Filter group mode
# This option determines whether members of this group have their web access
# unfiltered, filtered, or banned. This mechanism replaces the "banneduserlist"
# and "exceptionuserlist" files from previous versions.
#
# 0 = banned
# 1 = filtered
# 2 = unfiltered (exception)
#
# Only filter groups with a mode of 1 need to define phrase, URL, site, extension,
# mimetype and PICS lists; in other modes, these options are ignored to conserve
# memory.
#
# Defaults to 0 if unspecified.
# Unauthenticated users are treated as being in the first filter group.
groupmode = 1

# Filter group name
# Used to fill in the -FILTERGROUP- placeholder in the HTML template file, and to
# name the group in the access logs
# Defaults to empty string

# headers causing a request to be blocked.
# Headers are matched/replaced on a line-by-line basis, not as a contiguous
# block.
# Use for example, to remove cookies or prevent certain user-agents.

# Weighted phrase mode
# Optional; overrides the weightedphrasemode option in dansguardian.conf
# for this particular group.  See documentation for supported values in
# that file.
#weightedphrasemode = 0

# Naughtiness limit
# This the limit over which the page will be blocked.  Each weighted phrase is given
# a value either positive or negative and the values added up.  Phrases to do with
# good subjects will have negative values, and bad subjects will have positive
# values.  See the weightedphraselist file for examples.
# As a guide:
# 50 is for young children,  100 for old children,  160 for young adults.
naughtynesslimit = 50

# Search term blocking
# Search terms can be extracted from search URLs and filtered using the
# bannedphraselist, weightedphraselist and exceptionphraselist, with a separate
# threshold for blocking than that used for normal page content.
# To do this, the first two options below must be enabled.
#
# Search engine regular expression list
# List of regular expressions for matching search engine URLs.  It is assumed
# that the search terms themselves will be contained within the first submatch
# of each expression.
#searchengineregexplist = '/etc/dansguardian/lists/searchengineregexplist'
#
# Search term limit
# The limit over which requests will be blocked for containing search terms
# which match the weightedphraselist.  This should usually be lower than the
# 'naughtynesslimit' value above, because the amount of text being filtered
# is only a few words, rather than a whole page.
# This option must be uncommented if searchengineregexplist is uncommented.
# A value of 0 here indicates that search terms should be extracted,
# for logging/reporting purposes, but no filtering should be performed
# on the resulting text.
#searchtermlimit = 30
#
# Search term lists
# If the three lines below are uncommented, search term blocking will use
# the banned, weighted & exception phrases from these lists, instead of using
# the same phrase lists as for page content.  This is optional but recommended,
# as weights for individual phrases in the "normal" lists may not be
# appropriate for blocking when those phrases appear in a much smaller block
# of text.
# Please note that all or none of the below should be uncommented, not a
# mixture.

# Category display threshold
# This option only applies to pages blocked by weighted phrase filtering.
# Defines the minimum score that must be accumulated within a particular
# category in order for it to show up on the block pages' category list.
# All categories under which the page scores positively will be logged; those
# that were not displayed to the user appear in brackets.
#
# -1 = display only the highest scoring category
# 0 = display all categories (default)
# > 0 = minimum score for a category to be displayed
categorydisplaythreshold = 0

# Embedded URL weighting
# When set to something greater than zero, this option causes URLs embedded within a
# page's HTML (from links, image tags, etc.) to be extracted and checked against the
# bannedsitelist and bannedurllist. Each link to a banned page causes the amount set
# here to be added to the page's weighting.
# The behaviour of this option with regards to multiple occurrences of a site/URL is
# affected by the weightedphrasemode setting.
#
# NB: Currently, this feature uses regular expressions that require the PCRE library.
# As such, it is only available if you compiled DansGuardian with '--enable-pcre=yes'.
# You can check compile-time options by running 'dansguardian -v'.
#
# Set to 0 to disable.
# Defaults to 0.
# WARNING: This option is highly CPU intensive!

# Temporary Denied Page Bypass
# This provides a link on the denied page to bypass the ban for a few minutes.  To be
# secure it uses a random hashed secret generated at daemon startup.  You define the
# number of seconds the bypass will function for before the deny will appear again.
# To allow the link on the denied page to appear you will need to edit the template.html
# or dansguardian.pl file for your language.
# 300 = enable for 5 minutes
# 0 = disable ( defaults to 0 )
# -1 = enable but you require a separate program/CGI to generate a valid link

# Rather than generating a random key you can specify one.  It must be more than 8 chars.

# Infection/Scan Error Bypass
# Similar to the 'bypass' setting, but specifically for bypassing files scanned and found
# to be infected, or files that trigger scanner errors - for example, archive types with
# recognised but unsupported compression schemes, or corrupt archives.
# The option specifies the number of seconds for which the bypass link will be valid.
# 300 = enable for 5 minutes
# 0 = disable (default)
# -1 = enable, but require a separate program/CGI to generate a valid link

# Infection/Scan Error Bypass on Scan Errors Only

# not when a file is found to contain a virus.

# off = disable

# Disable content scanning
# If you enable this option you will disable content scanning for this group.
# Content scanning primarily is AV scanning (if enabled) but could include
# other types.

# Enable Deep URL Analysis
# When enabled, DG looks for URLs within URLs, checking against the bannedsitelist and
# bannedurllist. This can be used, for example, to block images originating from banned
# sites from appearing in Google Images search results, as the original URLs are
# embedded in the thumbnail GET requests.
# (on|off) default = off

# reportinglevel
#
# -1 = log, but do not block - Stealth mode
#  0 = just say 'Access Denied'
#  1 = report why but not what denied phrase
#  2 = report fully
#  3 = use HTML template file (accessdeniedaddress ignored) - recommended
#
# If defined, this overrides the global setting in dansguardian.conf for
# members of this filter group.
#

# accessdeniedaddress is the address of your web server to which the cgi
# dansguardian reporting script was copied. Only used in reporting levels
# 1 and 2.
#
# This webserver must be either:
#  1. Non-proxied. Either a machine on the local network, or listed as an
#     exception in your browser's proxy configuration.
#  2. Added to the exceptionsitelist. Option 1 is preferable; this option is
#     only for users using both transparent proxying and a non-local server
#     to host this script.
#
# If defined, this overrides the global setting in dansguardian.conf for
# members of this filter group.
#
#accessdeniedaddress = 'http://YOURSERVER.YOURDOMAIN/cgi-bin/dansguardian.pl'

# HTML Template override
# If defined, this specifies a custom HTML template file for members of this
# filter group, overriding the global setting in dansguardian.conf. This is
# only used in reporting level 3.
#
# The default template file path is <languagedir>/<language>/template.html
# e.g. /usr/share/dansguardian/languages/ukenglish/template.html when using 'ukenglish'
# language.
#
# This option generates a file path of the form:
# <languagedir>/<language>/<htmltemplate>
# e.g. /usr/share/dansguardian/languages/ukenglish/custom.html
