# ErrorFile: Defines the HTML file to send when a given HTTP error

#
# Turns on upstream proxy support.
#
# The upstream rules allow you to selectively route upstream connections
# based on the host/domain of the site being accessed.
#
# For example:
#  # connection to test domain goes through testproxy
#
#config upstream
#	option type proxy
#	option via testproxy:8008
#	option target ".test.domain.invalid"
#
#config upstream
#	option type proxy
#	option via testproxy:8008
#	option target ".our_testbed.example.com"
#
#config upstream
#	option type proxy
#	option via testproxy:8008
#	option target "192.168.128.0/255.255.254.0"
#
#  # no upstream proxy for internal websites and unqualified hosts
#
#config upstream
#	option type reject
#	option target ".internal.example.com"
#
#config upstream
#	option type reject
#	option target "www.example.com"
#
#config upstream
#	option type reject
#	option target "10.0.0.0/8"
#
#config upstream
#	option type reject
#	option target "192.168.0.0/255.255.254.0"
#
#config upstream
#	option type reject
#	option target "."
#
#  # default upstream is internet firewall
#
#config upstream
#	option type proxy
#	option via firewall.internal.example.com:80
#
# The LAST matching rule wins the route decision.  As you can see, you
# can use a host, or a domain:
#  name     matches host exactly
#  .name    matches any host in domain "name"
#  .        matches any host with no domain (in 'empty' domain)
#  IP/bits  matches network/mask
#  IP/mask  matches network/mask
