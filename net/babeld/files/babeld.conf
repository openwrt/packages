# babel config file
#
# This config file simply documents sample entries. 
# "redistribute" means: redistribute routes from other routing protocols
# into babel. "local" means addresses assigned to local interfaces.
#
# You do not need to edit this file: you can use /etc/config/babeld
# instead (sections "interface" and "filter").  Both files can be used
# simultaneously (the rules of this file are executed first).

# the default rules are:
#
## redistribute local 
## redistribute deny
#
# this says, redistribute local addresses but no other routes


# redistribute IPv4 default route into babel 
## redistribute local ip 0.0.0.0/0 le 0 metric 128

# same but for IPv6
## redistribute local ip ::/0 le 0 metric 128


# don't redistribute all local addresses, only selected ones
# after the first line, the "deny" rules kicks in. After the "deny"
# no redistribute local rules are going to match
## redistribute local ip 192.160.4.0/24 
## redistribute local deny


# Babel refuses to redistribute routes with a protocol number of "boot";
# this is standard practice, and means that you cannot easily
# redistribute the default route installed by dhcp.  It is however
# possible to redistribute such route by explicitly specifying "proto 3"
# on the redistribute line.
## redistribute ip 0.0.0.0/0 le 0 proto 3 metric 128
