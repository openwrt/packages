Subject: [PATCH] Fix buffer overflow in extract_status_code()

Issue #960 identified that the buffer allocated for copying the
HTTP status code could overflow if the http response was corrupted.

This commit changes the way the status code is read, avoids copying
data, and also ensures that the status code is three digits long,
is non-negative and occurs on the first line of the response.
