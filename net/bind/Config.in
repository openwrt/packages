config BIND_ENABLE_FILTER_AAAA
	bool

	prompt "Enable filtering of AAAA records returned to the client"
	help
		BIND 9 has an option to filter AAAA (IPv6 address) records
		returned to the client based on the transport used for the
		query, and other filtering conditions. This filtering does
		not affect the recursive queries made by the server (if
		any) as a result of the client request.

		Additional details are available at

config BIND_LIBJSON
	bool
	default n
	prompt "Include libjson support in bind-server"
	help
		BIND 9 supports reporting statistics about usage. libjson
		is required to report server statistics in JSON format. 
		Building with libjson support will require the libjson-c
		package to be installed as well.

config BIND_LIBXML2
	bool
	default n
	prompt "Include libxml2 support in bind-server"
	help
		BIND 9 supports reporting statistics about usage. 
		libxml2 is required to report server statistics in XML

    help
        Enable BIND support for Edwards Curve DNSSEC signing algorithms
        described in RFC 8080.

        Note that this requires OpenSSL 1.1, which is not currently
        the available in OpenWRT, so it is disabled by default.
