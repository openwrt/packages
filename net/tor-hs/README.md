# Tor Hidden service configurator
The **tor-hs** package tries to simplify creation of hidden services on OpenWrt routers.

## Requirements
To run **tor-hs**, you need the Tor package with uci config support (it was added
with [this commit](https://github.com/openwrt/packages/commit/ca6528f002d74445e3d0a336aeb9074fc337307a) ).

## Installation
To install the package, simply run

```sh
opkg update
opkg install tor-hs
```

## Configuration
Uci configuration is located in **/etc/config/tor-hs**

### Required section of configuration
There is one required section: **common**

Example of this section
```
config tor-hs common
	option GenConf "/etc/tor/torrc_hs"
	option HSDir "/etc/tor/hidden_service"
	option RestartTor "true"
	option UpdateTorConf "true"
```

#### Table with options description
| Type | Name | Default | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| option |GenConf | /etc/tor/torrc_generated|Config generated by `tor-hs`.|
| option | HSDir |/etc/tor/hidden_service|Directory with meta-data for hidden services (hostname,keys,etc).|
| option | RestartTor | true| It will restart `tor` after running **/etc/init.d/tor-hs start**.|
| option | UpdateTorConf | true|Update /etc/config/tor with config from **GenConf** option.|

### Hidden service configuration
If you want to create a new hidden service, you have to add a hidden-service section. For every hidden service, there should be a new **hidden-service** section.

Example of hidden service section for ssh server:

```
config hidden-service
	option Name 'sshd'
	option Description "Hidden service for ssh"
	option Enabled 'false'
	option IPv4 '127.0.0.1'
	#public port=2222, local port=22
	list PublicLocalPort '2222;22'
```

#### Table with options description

| Type | Name | Example value | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|	option | Name | sshd| Name of hidden service. It is used as directory name in **HSDir**|
|	option | Description| Hidden service for ssh| Description used in **rpcd** service|
|	option | Enabled |false| Enable hidden service after running the **tor-hs** init script|
|	option |IPv4 |127.0.0.1|Local IPv4 address of service. Service could run on another device. In that case OpenWrt will redirect communication.  |
|	list | PublicLocalPort| 2222;22| Public port is a port accessible via the Tor network. Local port is a local port of service.|
|option| HookScript |'/etc/tor/nextcloud-update.php'| Path to script which is executed after starting tor-hs. Script is executed with parameters **--update-onion** **hostname** . Hostname is replaced with Onion v3 address for given hidden service.

## Running service

To enable the `tor-hs` service run

```sh
/etc/init.d/tor-hs enable
/etc/init.d/tor-hs start

```
In case you enabled option *RestartTor* and *UpdateTorConf*, the hidden service should be running.
Otherwise, you should also restart the `tor` daemon.

```sh
/etc/init.d/tor restart
```

After that you should also restart the rpcd daemon, so you can use `tor-hs` RPCD service.
```sh
/etc/init.d/rpcd restart
```

### RPCD

RPCD service helps users to access basic information about hidden services on the router. After running HS it contains an onion URL for the given hidden service in the hostname value.

```sh
root@turris:/# ubus call tor-hs-rpc list-hs '{}'
{
	"hs-list": [
		{
			"name": "sshd",
			"description": "Hidden service for ssh",
			"enabled": "1",
			"ipv4": "127.0.0.1",
			"hostname": "****hidden-service-hostname****.onion",
			"ports": [
				"22;22"
			]
		}
	]
}
```
