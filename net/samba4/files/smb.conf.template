	## This parameter controls whether a remote client is allowed or required to use SMB encryption.
	## It has different effects depending on whether the connection uses SMB1 or SMB2 and newer:
	## If the connection uses SMB1, then this option controls the use of a Samba-specific extension to the SMB protocol introduced in Samba 3.2 that makes use of the Unix extensions.
	## If the connection uses SMB2 or newer, then this option controls the use of the SMB-level encryption that is supported in SMB version 3.0 and above and available in Windows 8 and newer. 
	## (default/auto,desired,required,off)
	#smb encrypt = default

	## set invalid users
	invalid users = root

	map to guest = Bad User

	## If this integer parameter is set to a non-zero value, Samba will read from files asynchronously when the request size is bigger than this value.
	## Note that it happens only for non-chained and non-chaining reads and when not using write cache.
	## The only reasonable values for this parameter are 0 (no async I/O) and 1 (always do async I/O).
	## (1/0)
	#aio read size = 0
	#aio write size = 0

	## If Samba has been built with asynchronous I/O support, Samba will not wait until write requests are finished before returning the result to the client for files listed in this parameter.
	## Instead, Samba will immediately return that the write request has been finished successfully, no matter if the operation will succeed or not.
	## This might speed up clients without aio support, but is really dangerous, because data could be lost and files could be damaged. 
	#aio write behind = /*.tmp/

	## lower CPU useage if supported and aio is disabled (aio read size = 0 ; aio write size = 0)

	## Disable that nmbd is acting as a WINS server for unknow netbios names
	#dns proxy = No

	## win/unix user mapping backend
	#idmap config * : backend = tdb

	## Allows the server name that is advertised through MDNS to be set to the hostname rather than the Samba NETBIOS name.
	## This allows an administrator to make Samba registered MDNS records match the case of the hostname rather than being in all capitals.
	## (netbios, mdns)
	mdns name = mdns

	## Clients that only support netbios won't be able to see your samba server when netbios support is disabled.
	#disable netbios = Yes

	## Setting this value to no will cause nmbd never to become a local master browser.
	#local master = no

	## (auto, yes) If this is set to yes, on startup, nmbd will force an election, and it will have a slight advantage in winning the election. It is recommended that this parameter is used in conjunction with domain master = yes, so that nmbd can guarantee becoming a domain master. 
	#preferred master = yes

	## (445 139) Specifies which ports the server should listen on for SMB traffic.
	## 139 is netbios/nmbd
	#smb ports = 445 139

	## This is a list of files and directories that are neither visible nor accessible.
	## Each entry in the list must be separated by a '/', which allows spaces to be included in the entry. '*' and '?' can be used to specify multiple files or directories as in DOS wildcards.
