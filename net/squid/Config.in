			Use GnuTLS in place of OpenSSL for the core features of receiving
			TLS connections from clients and making TLS connections to servers.
			The GnuTLS support is still very much experimental and should be
			tested before use.

			SSL-Bump and certificate generation features are not yet supported
			by GnuTLS builds. Nor are many other less commonly used Squid
			TLS/SSL features.

			squid.conf directives and configuration options which have undergone
			name changes from 'ssl' to 'tls' prefix in Squid-4 have GnuTLS
			support, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

			Advanced configuration with specific selection of ciphers and
			similar settings should still work, but needs the GnuTLS Priority
			Strings instead of the OpenSSL options when using GnuTLS.
