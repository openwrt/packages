bugfix - The dnscache postinst script had a bug that prevented djbdns from being compiled into a firmware image.
bugfix - The dnscache startup script now uses /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random as a source of randomness. Using /dev/random does not work on 2.6 kernels.
bugfix - dnscache no longer tries to use /tmp/resolv.conf.auto but /etc/resolv.conf instead. This only applies when useresolvconf==1.
change - In menuconfig: djbdns moved from network to network/DNS
change - Removed the dnscache postinst script to the dnscache startup script. The script configures dnscache to accept connections from certain local network adresses.
change - The dnscache startup script was cleaned up a bit.
change - default logging level is now info instead of notice.
enhancement - Added option to add list of resolvers to UCI config for use in forwardonly mode. Two OpenDNS example addresses are added as a default.
